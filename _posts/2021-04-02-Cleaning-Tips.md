title: Simple Tips for Keeping A Clean Home.
---  

I get it! We're all super busy -- all of the time! Keeping a clean house is hard enough, but keeping it clean all the time is even more difficult. As someone who can't function in a mess, I've developed habits that keep my house feeling clean all the time. Read along to learn how you can too!  

1: Organization   

This is the foundation!! Having a home for everything means when it's time for something to be put away, there's a place to put it. Having storage places for things is crucial (i.e. storage bins, baskets, shoe storage). Most of the time when something is laying around my house, it's because I'm not sure what to do with it. 

2: Pick Up As You Go

As you live, it's easy to just sit something anywhere. You leave your empty Amazon box on the dining table or all the shoes by the door. All of these things should have a home. Once you're done with them, put them where they belong immediately. This will make it much easier when you're cleaning the place. This one simple task will save you so much time and energy in the long run!

3: Clean Messes Immediately

I know, I know. It's a real pain. But just do it! If you let a mess just sit, it will become harder to clean. You cook dinner and the dishes need to be done. Let them sit and tomorrow they'll be all dry and crusty. Crusty dishes are the worst!! 

4: Do a Load of Laundry

For the most part, laundry is passive. Stuff a load in there! Be sure nothing is inside-out while loading (you'll thank me when it's time to fold). While it's washing, do something productive like taking care of other house chores. After the wash, pick out things that need to hang dry and throw the rest in the dryer. When it's time to fold, it should only take you 5 minutes!!

5: Add something Different to the Mix

Try to incorporate something new into the mix every day. Simple daily tasks to mix throughout the week would be something like dusting the house, wiping down the bathroom, vacuuming the house. 


All of these habits allow me to always have a clean home. They're simple enough that they are maintainable but big enough to make an impact. Involving these tips will allow you to feel better living in your house (and never feel embarrassed by an impromptu visitor).
